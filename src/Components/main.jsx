            I am Tatiana, a Full Stack Developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden.
            With a lifelong interest in technology, I decided to fully commit to
            my passion in 2022, enrolling in the developer program at IT
            HÃ¶gskolan in Gothenburg.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            During my time there, I had the opportunity to complete an
            internship at Junio AB, where my team and I developed a school
            platform that allows teachers to seamlessly manage and share
            educational materials with their students.

              Coming from a background rich in customer-focused roles, I bring a
              unique perspective to software development. My ability to
              understand customer needs, combined with my technical expertise,
              allows me to create solutions that are not only functional but
              also user-centric.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            I am particularly passionate about accessibility and inclusivity in
            tech, which is why WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a
            key focus for me.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            What excites me most about software development is the constant
            evolution of the field. I thrive on learning new technologies and
            tackling complex challenges.
